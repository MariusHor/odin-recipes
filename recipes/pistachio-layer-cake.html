        <h2>Description</h2>
        <p>This <em>pistachio</em> layer cake with cream cheese buttercream is really special. The layers are light, moist, and not too sweet, with plenty of 
            pistachio <strong>flavor</strong>. The presentation with the swirled top and pistachio-coated sides make it a real showpiece. Layers can be made, wrapped well, 
            and frozen up to a month in advance.</p>
        <h2>Ingredients</h2>
        <ul>
            <li>3 cups unsalted pistachios</li>
            <li>2 cups all-purpose flour</li>
            <li>2 teaspoons baking powder</li>
            <li>5 large egg whites</li>
            <li>1 cup whole milk</li>
            <li>2 teaspoons vanilla extract</li>
        </ul>
        <h2>Steps</h2>
        <ol>
            <li>Preheat the oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C). Spray three 8-inch round cake pans with cooking spray. Line each pan with a round piece of parchment paper, and spray with cooking spray.</li>
            <li>Prepare the cake: pulse pistachios in a food processor until finely ground, 10 to 15 pulses. Transfer 1 1/2 cups ground pistachios to a bowl with flour, baking powder, salt, and baking soda; whisk until well combined and set aside. Place remaining ground pistachios, about 1 1/3 cups, in a bowl and reserve for finishing the cake.</li>
            <li>Beat butter and white sugar for cake in a stand mixer fitted with a paddle attachment on medium-high speed, scraping down the sides as needed, until light and fluffy, about 3 minutes. Add egg whites and beat on high speed until combined, about 2</li>
            <li>Bake in the preheated oven until a toothpick inserted into the center of each pan removes cleanly, 22 to 24 minutes. Cool cakes in the pans for about 10 minutes. Run a table knife around the edges to loosen cakes, then invert carefully onto a serving plate or cooling rack. Let cool completely, about 30 minutes.</li>
            <li>Place one cake layer on a serving plate or cake stand. Top with 1 cup buttercream and 1 tablespoon ground pistachios, and spread evenly over the surface using a spatula. Place second cake layer on top; top with 1 cup buttercream and 1 tablespoon ground pistachios, and spread evenly over the surface. Place third cake layer on top, and spread 1 cup buttercream evenly over the surface. Spread 2 cups buttercream evenly around sides of assembled cake and smooth with a spatula. Transfer cake to the refrigerator and chill for 30 minutes.</li>
        </ol>
