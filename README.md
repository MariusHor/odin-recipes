This will be my first project where I will put in practice what I have learned so far on HTML.
I will be writing the Html document from scratch, trying do so with the least amount of help possible.
Inside the Head of the Html I will set a title for the webpage and I will also set the charset.
The Body will contain headings, paragraphs, where I will manipulate text with 'strong' and 'em' tags, lists as well as images and links.
By the end of the project I want to really learn these first steps in order to implement them with ease on bigger projects in the future.
